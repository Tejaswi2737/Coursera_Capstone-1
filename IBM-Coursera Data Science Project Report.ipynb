    "The purpose of this project is to identify the trending food ventures in each suburb of Sydney, Australia with accessible public transportation. Sydney has around 600 plus suburbs in the city with an excellent metro system and an amazing variety of cuisines available to gorge on. By calculating the distance from the nearest train stations and clustering restaurants based on this distance, anyone new to the beautiful city of Sydney can enjoy the food there without much of a hassle about transport. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above problem has been addressed by finding the trending food places in each suburb of Sydney which are closest to train stations. Specifically, this report will be targeted to travelers interested in visiting the top food places which are are convenient to travel to and from in Sydney. We are particularly focusing on the train stations in Sydney as their metro network is very reliable with services running from 4am to around midnight on most train lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do the analysis as mentioned above, initially a list of all the suburbs, all the train stations and the trending restaurants in Sydney are obtained. From this data, the nearest train station to each restaurant is found based on their locations and the distances calculated. After clustering the restaurants based on the distances previously calculated, we can come to a conclusion about the most accessible restaurants, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science methodologies and the K-means clustering algorithm have been used to get useful data and generate different clusters of food places all over Sydney based on their distances from the nearest train stations."

It is not necessary that cluster 0 always has the minimum distance restaurants. It is important to understand how the clustering algorithm works on the distances array given as the input - the algorithm divides the different distances into different clusters so that each cluster covers a particular range of distances.
